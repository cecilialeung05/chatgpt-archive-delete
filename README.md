## Troubleshooting  
### Why isn’t the delete/archive button appearing?  
- Refresh the page and check if the extension is active (`chrome://extensions/`).  

### My chats aren't deleting/archiving!  
- Open Developer Tools (`F12` > Console) and check if the API requests are failing.  
- Try **refreshing ChatGPT** and **reselecting chats** before clicking archive/delete.  

### Can I undo a delete/archive?  
- Unfortunately, no. Once a chat is deleted, it **cannot be recovered**. Be careful when selecting chats!
